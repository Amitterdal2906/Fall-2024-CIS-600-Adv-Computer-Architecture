Create a "full adder" architecture. Create a five bit "ALU" whose only function is add. Switches 0-4 will contain one binary number, switches 5-9 will contain another. Connect the switches to the input on the add ALU (carry in to bit 0 is zero) and connect the ALU output to LED 0-5 (yes 6 LEDs). Use both the pushbutton clock and a clock that pulses every 2 seconds to verify your hardware operates properly.
